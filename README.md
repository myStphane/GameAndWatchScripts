# GameAndWatchScripts
my Game &amp; Watch Script (Backup &amp; retro-go)

Notes:
- UbuntuInstall.txt is a scrappy text file with all my commands ran for an Ubuntu install under an Oracle VM VirtualBox env. for G&W Backup & retro-go
- On script run, for each option/action, a user key-press is requested, to avoid any miss run actions => user can press Ctrl+C to abort it.


## 0_menu.sh
Aim: (my) menu / Ubuntu for the G&W Backup tools

Missing:
